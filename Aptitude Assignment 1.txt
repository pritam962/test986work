1)For the line x = 2, the value of x is always 2, while y can take any value. Therefore, the line is a vertical line passing through the point (2, y) for any y.

For the line y = 4, the value of y is always 4, while x can take any value. Therefore, the line is a horizontal line passing through the point (x, 4) for any x.

The two lines intersect at the point (2, 4) since both lines have x = 2 and y = 4 in common.

2)2X + 3Y = 9
7X + 9Y = -6

We can use the concept of determinants to analyze the situation.

The system will have a unique solution if the determinants of the coefficients of X and Y are non-zero, and the determinants of the coefficients of X and Y with the constants on the right-hand side are also non-zero.

Let's calculate the determinants:

D = (2 * 9) - (3 * 0) = 18
Dx = (9 * 9) - (3 * (-6)) = 117
Dy = (2 * (-6)) - (7 * 9) = -72

Since D is non-zero, the system is consistent. If both Dx and Dy are non-zero, the system will have a unique solution.

Since both Dx and Dy are non-zero (117 and -72 respectively), the system has a unique solution.

Therefore, the system of equations:

2X + 3Y = 9
7X + 9Y = -6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3)To determine the number of solutions or "keys" for this equation, we need more information or additional equations. A single equation in two variables can have an infinite number of solutions or no solution at all.

If we have another equation in x and y, we can solve the system of equations to determine the number of solutions. Without another equation, we cannot definitively determine the number of solutions for the given equation.

Therefore, based on the given information, we cannot determine the number of solutions or "keys" for the equation 7x + 9y = -5.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4)If a, b, and c are all equal to zero (a = b = c = 0), the equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 becomes:

0x^2 + 0x + 0 = 0

This simplifies to:

0 = 0

The equation 0 = 0 is an example of an identity. It is true for all values of x. In this case, the equation represents an infinitely large set of solutions.

5)Given that B's income is Rs 3000, we can set up the following equation:

3x = 3000

Solving for x:

x = 3000/3
x = 1000

Therefore, A's income is 2x = 2 * 1000 = Rs 2000.

Now, let's find the ratio of their expenditures. We are given their savings, so we can subtract the savings from their respective incomes to find their expenditures.

Expenditure of A = Income of A - Savings of A = Rs 2000 - Rs 500 = Rs 1500
Expenditure of B = Income of B - Savings of B = Rs 3000 - Rs 700 = Rs 2300

The ratio of their expenditures is 1500:2300, which simplifies to 15:23.

Therefore, the ratio of their expenditures is 15:23.
